# My-Journey-with-AWS-and-Certification-Preparation
During my journey with AWS, I had the opportunity to explore and work with a variety of services, which also led me to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. Throughout this process, I created and compiled a collection of helpful resources and materials that played a key role in my understanding and memorization of the content. This post aims to showcase some of the tables and summaries I developed, which significantly assisted me in retaining key concepts and passing the exam.
